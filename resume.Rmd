## Research Experience

<p style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 0;">
  <strong>Research Intern at Bioinformatics Lab, Nankai University</strong>
  <span>Dec. 2024 – May 2025</span>
</p>

- Developed a novel hybrid dynamic-static topological molecular representation in Python to enhance the
prediction of key polymer properties  
- Engineered 41-dimensional feature vectors by integrating multi-scale simplicial complex analysis for static 3D
structure features with persistent homology barcodes for dynamic multi-scale topological features  
- Achieved significant performance improvements over traditional geometric deep learning models on complex
polymer datasets, and documented the full methodology and results in a bachelor’s thesis  


<p style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 0;">
  <strong>Member of a 4-student research group, remote, MIT</strong>
  <span>Jan. 2024 – Mar. 2024</span>
</p>

- Investigated the influence of architectural modifications on object detection performance by conducting a
literature review on the development of the YOLO model family  
- Enhanced the YOLOv5 model’s performance by improving the C3 module, refining the loss function, and
implemented cross-validation for robust training 

<p style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 0;">
  <strong>Leader of a 3-student research group, remote, CMU</strong>
  <span>Jul. 2023 – Aug. 2023</span>
</p>
- Investigated machine learning pipeline for image classification by constructing and optimizing Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) algorithms built with Keras  
- Employed various techniques to boost model performance including dynamic learning rate algorithms,
backpropagation optimization, and data augmentation
